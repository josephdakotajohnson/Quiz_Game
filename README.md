## Features

 - There is a title, a button that takes you to a quiz, and a button that lets you view the high scores.
 - When you click the quiz button, you get asked 10 questions about fish.
 - Then you are presented with the option to submit your initials to the high scores board.
 - When you click the high scores button, you get to view all the high scores saved to the current local storage.
 - You are also timed during the quiz.
 - Answering a question right gives you a point while answering a question wrong lowers the timer by 10 seconds.
 - When the timer runs out, the quiz automatically ends.
